This repo is Docker-only for the MVP to keep dev and devops overhead low.

Start here:
- `backend/README.md` for gateway contracts and Docker Compose usage.
- `backend/cmd/services-health/README.md` for the Command Center.
- `backend/cmd/admin-portal/README.md` for the Admin Portal.

If/when we move off Docker, see `NON_DOCKER_TODO.md`.

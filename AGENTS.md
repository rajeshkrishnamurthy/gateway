# AGENTS.md - repo root

## Scope
This file applies to all work in this repository.

## Required reading order
- Read the closest AGENTS.md before making changes.
- For backend work, read the relevant docs in `backend/spec/` before coding.
- Use README files for operational posture and run instructions.
- Use `backend/PLANS.md` for ExecPlan rules; ExecPlans live under `plans/`.

## Behavior
- Treat specs as canonical for system semantics.
- Update specs/README in the same change when behavior changes.
